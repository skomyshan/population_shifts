### Final Project - Group 6

This README represents a synopsis of our final project. It starts with the topic that we will be exploring, including an overview of the main goals and hypotheses that we intend to answer. In order to explore this topic we devised a plan to utilize machine learning. As an overview of this plan we provide an outline of the database we plan to construct and the machine learning techniques that will be used to process this data. Finally, we end with our team members and the roles for each, understanding that these roles will shift throughout the life of the project.

### Presentation
- Our sected topic: Impact of War on Countries Accross the World

- Reason why we selected their topic: The impact of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been felt acorss the world and will only continue to cause waves as we move further into the conflict. We want to know how 

- Description of our source of data: FAOSTAT (crops/commodities), inflation, import/exports, Military expenditure

- Questions we hope to answer with the data: How does war and other military actions affect counties involved and those who are not?


### Database

***Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database***

### Machine Learning Model

***Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data***

### Team Members and Roles

- Bhavna Aggarwal: Viz
- Jack Eisenreich: Triangle
- Suzanna Komyshan: Square
- Kurt Minges: X
- Sophie Xue: Circle

Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.
Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.
Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.
X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.
